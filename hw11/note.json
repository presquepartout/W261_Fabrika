Give an example (in the context of machine learning) of each mechanism (at a highlevel). Feel free to cut and paste code examples from the lectures to support your answer.\n\n### 11.0 Solution \n\n**Caching**: One of the most important capabilities in Spark is persisting (or caching) a dataset in memory across operations. When you persist an RDD, each node stores any partitions of it that it computes in memory and reuses them in other actions on that dataset (or datasets derived from it). This allows future actions to be much faster (often by more than 10x). Caching is a key tool for iterative algorithms and fast interactive use.\n\nYou can mark an RDD to be persisted using the persist() or cache() methods on it. The first time the RDD is computed in an action, it will be kept in memory on the nodes. Spark’s cache is fault-tolerant – if any partition of an RDD is lost, it will automatically be recomputed using the transformations that originally created it.\n\n**Broadcast**: Normally, when a function passed to a Spark operation (such as map or reduce) is executed on a remote cluster node, it works on separate copies of all the variables used in the function.Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a read-only variable cached on each machine rather than shipping a copy of it with tasks. Broadcast variables can be used, for example, to give every node a copy of a large input dataset in an efficient manner. \n\n\n**Non ML Example**: Suppose we want to join 2 files and one file is small and can be kept in memory, and the other file is 10TB in size. The join can be achieved by doing a mapside join only. In this case assume we have 4 nodes and each node can execute 2 tasks in parallel and suppose we need to run in total 16 map tasks. Without broadcast, the small file will be passed 16 times while with broadcast it will be passed only 4 times.\n\n\n**ML example**:\nConsider we want to write linear regression algorithm using gradient descent. In this scenario we will iterate over the same input training data set. As the input dataset is not changing, we would use caching here. \n\nIn each iteration we are calculating the weight vector. In this case if we have multiple executors and large dataset, the task of calculating the weight vector will be distributed. As we need to pass the previous weight vector to each task, we can use broadcast to cache the weight vector, which will make sure all the executors have a copy of it versus passing the value with each task.\n\n**Code Example of caching and broadcasting:**\nTake the following ML code (Logistic Regression w/o regularization) as an example: \n- The `data` RDD is reused in each iteration, and so it is persisted across all the iterations by caching.\n- In each iteration, the weights `w` is broadcasted to all the nodes since all tasks need to access it.\n\u003cbr\\\u003e\n```\ndef logisticRegressionGDReg(data, wInitial\u003dNone, learningRate\u003d0.05, iterations\u003d50):\n    featureLen \u003d len(data.take(1)[0].x)\n    n \u003d data.count()\n    if wInitial is None:\n        w \u003d np.random.normal(size\u003dfeatureLen) # w should be broadcasted if it is large\n    else:\n        w \u003d wInitial\n    for i in range(iterations):\n        wBroadcast \u003d sc.broadcast(w)\n        gradient \u003d data.map(lambda p: (1 / (1 + np.exp(-p.y*np.dot(wBroadcast.value, p.x)))-1) * p.y * np.array(p.x))\\\n                    .reduce(lambda a, b: a + b)\n        w \u003d w - learningRate * gradient / n\n    return w\ndata \u003d sc.textFile(\u0027data.csv\u0027).map(readPoint).cache()\nlogisticRegressionGD(data)\n```\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\n",
